 *
 * Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it,
 * and return the result of the evaluation.
 *
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical
 * expressions, such as eval().
 *
 * Input: s = "1 + 1"
 * Output: 2
 *
 * Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
 * Output: 3
 *
 * 乘除直接计算，加减进队列
