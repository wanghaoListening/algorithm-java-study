 *Given a string s and a dictionary of strings wordDict, return true if s can be
 * segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.
 *
 * Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.
 *
 * Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
 *
 * Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
 * Output: true
 * Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
 * Note that you are allowed to reuse a dictionary word.
