 *
 * Given an array nums which consists of non-negative integers and an integer m, you can split the array into m non-empty continuous subarrays.
 *
 * Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these m subarrays.
 *
 * Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
 * Output: 18
 * Explanation:
 * There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
 * The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
 * where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
