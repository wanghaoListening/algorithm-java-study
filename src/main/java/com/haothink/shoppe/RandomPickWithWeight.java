 *
 * You are given an array of positive integers w where w[i] describes the weight of ith index (0-indexed).
 *
 * We need to call the function pickIndex() which randomly returns an integer in the range [0, w.length - 1].
 * pickIndex() should return the integer proportional to its weight in the w array. For example, for w = [1, 3],
 * the probability of picking the index 0 is 1 / (1 + 3) = 0.25 (i.e 25%) while the probability of picking the
 * index 1 is 3 / (1 + 3) = 0.75 (i.e 75%).
 *
 * More formally, the probability of picking index i is w[i] / sum(w).
 *
 * Input
 * ["Solution","pickIndex"]
 * [[[1]],[]]
 * Output
 * [null,0]
