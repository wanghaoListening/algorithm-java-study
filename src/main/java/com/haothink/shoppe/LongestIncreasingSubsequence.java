/**
 * Created by wanghao on 2021/8/3
 *
 * Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.
 *
 * A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
 * For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].
 *
 * Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
 * Output: 4
 * Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
 *
 * Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
 * Output: 4
 *
 * 动态规划：
