 *
 * Given two non-negative integers num1 and num2 represented as strings, return the
 * product of num1 and num2, also represented as a string.
 *
 * Note: You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.
 *  * 竖式乘法
 *  * 对于例子中的123 * 456，我们可以通过得到:
 *  * 3 * 456 + 20 * 456 + 100 *456 = 1368 + 9120 + 45600 = 56088
