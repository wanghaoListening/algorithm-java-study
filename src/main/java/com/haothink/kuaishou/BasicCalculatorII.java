 *
 * Given a string s which represents an expression, evaluate this expression and return its value.
 *
 * The integer division should truncate toward zero.
 *
 * You may assume that the given expression is always valid. All intermediate results will be in
 * the range of [-231, 231 - 1].
 *
 * Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as
 * mathematical expressions, such as eval().
 *
 * Input: s = "3+2*2"
 * Output: 7
 *
 * Input: s = " 3/2 "
 * Output: 1
