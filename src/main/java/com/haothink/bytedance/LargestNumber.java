 * Created by wanghao on 2021/9/11
 *
 * Given a list of non-negative integers nums, arrange them such that they form the largest number.
 *
 * Note: The result may be very large, so you need to return a string instead of an integer.
 *
 * Input: nums = [10,2]
 * Output: "210"
 *
 * Input: nums = [3,30,34,5,9]
 * Output: "9534330"
