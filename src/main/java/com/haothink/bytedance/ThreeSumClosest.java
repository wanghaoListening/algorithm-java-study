 *
 * Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers in nums such that the sum is closest to target.
 *
 * Return the sum of the three integers.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
 *
 * Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
