 *
 * You are given a string s and an array of strings words of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in s that is a concatenation of each word in words exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.
 *
 * You can return the answer in any order.
 *
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 *
 * Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
 * Output: [0,9]
 * Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively.
 * The output order does not matter, returning [9,0] is fine too.
